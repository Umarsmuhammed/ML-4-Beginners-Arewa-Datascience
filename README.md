# Arewa Datascience Machine Learning for Beginners

Arewa Datascience presents this 10-week online course, as part of the Arewa Datascience Fellowship. In this curriculum, you will learn about  **classical machine learning**, using pandas and Scikit-learn libraries. The curriculum does not include deep-learning, as it is anticipated to be covered in the future (second cohort).

# Getting Started

## Prerequisite:

> Our fellows have completed the [Python-30 Day challenge](https://github.com/arewadataScience/30-Days-of-Python) that we prepared. If you are following this curriculum, we expect you to have a basic understanding of Python.


**[Fellows](https://arewadatascience.org/fellows.html)**, to use this curriculum, fork the entire repo to your own GitHub account and complete the exercises on your own or with a group:

- Start with a pre-lecture quiz.
- Read the lecture and complete the activities, pausing and reflecting at each knowledge check.
- Try to create the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than running the solution code; however that code is available in the `/solution` folders in each project-oriented lesson.
- Take the post-lecture quiz.
- Complete the challenge.
- Complete the assignment.
- After completing a lesson group, visit the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/c/1892169859/1) and "learn out loud" by writing about the new knowledge you gained. Don't forget to write a [medium](https://medium.com) blog post about what you learn each week.

## Pedagogy

We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is hands-on **project-based** and that it includes **frequent quizzes**. In addition, this curriculum has a common **theme** to give it cohesion.

By ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and should be taken in whole. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 10-week cycle. This curriculum also includes a postscript on real-world applications of ML, which can be used as extra credit or as a basis for discussion.

## Each lesson includes:

- optional sketchnote
- optional supplemental video
- pre-lecture warmup quiz
- written lesson
- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- knowledge checks
- a challenge
- supplemental reading
- assignment
- post-lecture quiz

> **A note about languages**: These lessons are primarily written in Python, but many are also available in R. To complete an R lesson, go to the `/solution` folder and look for R lessons. They include an .rmd extension that represents an **R Markdown** file which can be simply defined as an embedding of `code chunks` (of R or other languages) and a `YAML header` (that guides how to format outputs such as PDF) in a `Markdown document`. As such, it serves as an exemplary authoring framework for data science since it allows you to combine your code, its output, and your thoughts by allowing you to write them down in Markdown. Moreover, R Markdown documents can be rendered to output formats such as PDF, HTML, or Word.
